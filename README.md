### *Map Page*

Users can view recommended places on the map, along with a heatmap that transitions from blue to red, indicating varying levels of busyness in different zones and streets. The markers offer two options: users can choose to see the best locations or view all locations. The busyness forecast allows users to select a specific time point to observe the heatmap's effects.
